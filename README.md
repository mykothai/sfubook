# Project Abstract
SFU Pre-Plan is a web application designed to provide users with a simplified way to plan the courses they want. This web app will effectively reduce the time spent looking for web pages that display information about SFU courses. Moreover, a simplified and interactive UI will display course relations in the form of a tree and every node carries further information about the course. User’s will be able to view a program’s entire course dependency or select courses to view specific respective prerequisites and corequisites. A user portal will be available to those who wish to register with SFU Pre-Plan in order to be able to save any schedules or plans which they have created. SFU Pre-Pan will achieve this through APIs that grab data from SFU websites and a parser which will extract the relevant data. Furthermore, our motivation to develop an application such as this stems from the quality of the only platform that displays course information, which is go.sfu. The offered webpages are tedious to navigate and are fairly counter-intuitive in their display of courses. SFU Pre-Plan will enable users to view course relations in a tree like format in order to simplify the planning procedure of SFU students.
